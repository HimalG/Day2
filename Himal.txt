Hi! I'm Himal Gyawali. I'm temporarily residing in New Baneshwor, Kathmandu. My permanent residence is Butwal, Rupandehi.
I'm a 8th sem CSIT student in Patan Multiple Campus. 

I was very much excited when I knew about the AWS AI/ML interestship program. Although I have completed some projects in 
other programming language, I'd not learnt python. So, I'm in the second category. But my enthusiasm towards learning has
constantly driven me to learn python and git/github for paving the way towards AI/ML. I've been through the git/github and
python courses in GCA which has provided me proper concepts and confidence. I'm really grateful towards your effort and 
I'm not letting this wonderful opportunity down. Thank you!
